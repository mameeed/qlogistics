        "content": "<div class=\"body-description\"><p>Warehousing space is at a premium and represents a significant portion of total supply chain costs. Consequently, shippers need to carefully evaluate the case for investing in more storage capacity.</p><hr><p>There are many warehousing configurations to choose from — and the range of options has increased markedly over recent years — but a potential solution that is cost-effective is to make the best use of existing capacity.</p><h2>Capacity-Building Strategies</h2><p>Penske Logistics helps shippers to get the most out of their warehouses without necessarily having to invest in more square footage. Here are some examples of these strategies. </p><h3>1. Keep Labor in the Loop</h3><p>The cost of labor can account for up to 65% of total warehouse fulfillment costs, depending on how a facility is owned and managed. And these costs can increase significantly in tight labor markets. </p><p>Moreover, the way a warehouse workforce is trained, deployed and managed has a huge impact on the facility's productivity. At Penske, \"Labor management combines software and engineering to maximize user performance and warehouse utilization,\" says <a href=\"https://www.penskelogistics.com/about/leadership-team/andy-moses\" class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" data-uw-rm-brl=\"PR\" data-uw-original-href=\"https://www.penskelogistics.com/about/leadership-team/andy-moses\">Andy Moses</a>, senior vice president of solutions and sales strategy, Penske Logistics. </p><p>The key to a successful program is \"keeping the lines of communication open and making sure the associates are kept in the loop at every step,\" he says. </p><p>Such an approach can yield multiple benefits from a warehouse capacity perspective. Here are some examples. </p><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li><strong>Improved planning.</strong> With better visibility into the volume and types of work being performed, a shipper can more effectively plan a facility's workforce requirements to meet operational demands. Better planning also supports a more balanced workforce that is attuned to variations in operational demands.</li><li><strong>More effective reporting.</strong> Giving the workforce visibility into their own performance and performance at a team level encourages competition and identifies drivers of efficiency. More visibility also promotes associate accountability.</li><li><strong>Adherence to preferred methods.</strong> With established labor standards, operations can be standardized and streamlined, which helps to eliminate non-value-added activities.</li></ul><p>Penske helped a major manufacturer that operated a 1.7 million square-foot, dual-use warehouse with 150 associates to implement a labor management program. Within the first eight months, employee productivity had increased by 22%.</p><h3>2. Make Quicker Picks</h3><p>Speeding up picking operations is an effective way to improve the utilization of a warehouse.</p><p>For instance, warehousing operations can be optimized by implementing systems that put inventory in bulk locations first and then replenish active locations to pick orders at ground level to increase pick speed. Introducing wearable scanners and voice picking are other ways to drive up pick speed.</p><h3>3. Optimize Slotting </h3><p>Another critically important component of a warehouse that can be reengineered to maximize capacity is a facility's slotting system.</p><p>One of the biggest services we provide for any customer is slotting analysis. Improving slotting methodology improves warehouse utilization as well as the efficiency of fulfillment operations.</p><p>A slotting analysis typically starts by identifying volumes and categorizing SKUs according to how fast they move through the warehouse. Category A products move the fastest, followed by B and C-class SKUs that move slower and slower still. A-class products are stored closer to the dock to minimize travel, whereas C-level items are located further from the dock or in higher locations where there are racking systems.</p><p>Penske engineers analyze inventory movement over time, taking various factors into account, such as seasonal variations in throughput. The findings are translated into rules that drive the warehouse management system (WMS). Over time, the rules are refined, and the WMS is updated.</p><p>Slotting patterns can be changed in line with shifts in demand. Some industries, such as <a href=\"https://www.penskelogistics.com/industries/food-and-beverage\" target=\"_self\" class=\"rm-stats-tracked\" data-uw-rm-brl=\"PR\" data-uw-original-href=\"https://www.penskelogistics.com/industries/food-and-beverage\">food and beverage</a>, change slotting patterns seasonally. Strawberries sell at specific times of the year, so you'll open up a part of the warehouse to store them for more efficient put-away and picking.</p><h3>4. Tailor the Space for Efficiency</h3><p>Choosing the most efficient layout for the mix of products being stored helps shippers to maximize the productivity of warehouse facilities.</p><p>Consider, for example, floor storage space. A standard aisle width might be 12 to 14 feet between product rows to allow forklifts to move smoothly. That distance can drop to 8 to 10 feet if a reach truck is used. If you go to VNA (very narrow aisle), around a 6-foot aisle, you need a wire-guided solution, which requires wires to be installed in the floor at the center of each aisle and wire guidance on the material handling equipment.</p><p>Alternatively, racking systems that utilize the vertical space in the warehouse may be a better option. Penske can design and install single-deep, double-deep, push-back, or drive-in racking systems to add storage locations in a warehouse.</p><h2>Keep Moving Forward</h2><p>The above strategies help shippers to use every square foot of space in their warehouses, but the effort should not stop there. </p><p>Building on these strategies with a continuous improvement program can yield more capacity-boosting opportunities.</p><p>Penske offers multiple options, such as the Kaizen+ program, which trains every associate and load planner to look for ways to eliminate wasteful processes and practices. There is a workflow to submit ideas, and improvements are tracked so that best practices can be shared. </p></div>"

Now, under FSMA, warehouse operators will need more detailed information.</p><h3>FSMA Warehouse Technology</h3><p>The most powerful systems – called Tier 1 – will provide that information. They are the most functionally robust and have embedded algorithms that can find ways to maximize productivity and the movement of product in and out of the warehouse.</p><p>All of the Tier 1 systems have database elements to store lot numbers or, more specifically, serial numbers of individual product units. Tier 1 systems can also link information together, which makes it easy to identify and locate any products involved in a food safety recall. As long as it is within the warehouse, you would know where to go to quarantine it.</p><h3>Warehouse Technology Overview</h3><p>Once products leave the warehouse, a Tier 1 WMS can allow operators to trace when the product was shipped and, in most cases, find the location where it was shipped.</p><p>Tier 1 systems also track perishable products by expiration dates and sell-by dates.</p><p>Companies looking to upgrade their WMS should allow adequate time for implementation. These are complicated systems, so they do have a longer lead time. The implementation of a tier 1 WMS requires significant planning and resources.</p><p>That lead time does vary based on the user's current WMS. For the systems to work, they need electronic data feeds and integration with the customers' ordering systems and enterprise resource planning. It takes too long on a daily basis to enter data manually.</p><p>When it comes to FSMA compliance, the warehouse is one link in the supply chain. We're dependent on our customers telling us they have the upstream supply chain covered when it comes to traceability. There are ways to make that linkage, and I see the need for the interchanges to become more and more connected as we move into the future.</p><h3>FSMA Technology Infographic</h3><div class=\"share-tab-img share-buttons share-trigger\"><img id=\"3ed95\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"62606ed31e60f0e9ada340e43f347243\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" class=\"rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image \" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 800 304'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-runner-src=\"https://www.penskelogistics.com/media-library/tier-one-infographic.jpg?id=23559252&amp;width=700&amp;quality=85\" width=\"800\" height=\"304\" alt=\"Tier-One Infographic\" data-adjusted-src=\"true\" data-uw-rm-alt-original=\"Tier-One Infographic\" data-uw-rm-alt=\"ALT\"><div class=\"share-media-panel\">\n    <ul class=\"social-tab-i\">\n        <li class=\"social-tab-buttons\">\n            <ul><li>\n    <a class=\"share share-fb\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"javascript:;\" aria-label=\"facebook\" data-uw-rm-empty-ctrl=\"\">\n        <span style=\"display:none;\">Share using fb</span>\n        <i class=\"icons-share fb sprite-shares-facebook sprite-shares-small-facebook\"></i>\n    </a>\n</li><li>\n    <a class=\"share share-tw\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"javascript:;\" aria-label=\"twitter\" data-uw-rm-empty-ctrl=\"\">\n        <span style=\"display:none;\">Share using tw</span>\n        <i class=\"icons-share tw sprite-shares-twitter sprite-shares-small-twitter\"></i>\n    </a>\n</li><li>\n    <a class=\"share share-pinterest\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"javascript:;\" aria-label=\"pinterest\" data-uw-rm-empty-ctrl=\"\">\n        <span style=\"display:none;\">Share using pt</span>\n        <i class=\"icons-share pt sprite-shares-pinterest sprite-shares-small-pinterest\"></i>\n    </a>\n</li><li>\n    <a class=\"share share-tumblr\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"javascript:;\" aria-label=\"Share using tl\" data-uw-rm-empty-ctrl=\"\">\n        <span style=\"display:none;\">Share using tl</span>\n        <i class=\"icons-share tl sprite-shares-tumblr sprite-shares-small-tumblr\"></i>\n    </a>\n</li><li>\n    <a class=\"share share-email\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:?subject=%0AWarehouse%20Technology%20a%20Must-Have%20in%20FSMA%20Environment%0A&amp;body=Hey%2C%20found%20this%20on%20Penske%20Logistics's%20Front%20Page%20and%20thought%20you%20would%20like%20it%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penskelogistics.com%2Findustries%2Ffood-and-beverage%2Ffsma-warehouse-technology%2F%233ed95\" aria-label=\"send an email to ?subject=%0AWarehouse%20Technology%20a%20Must-Have%20in%20FSMA%20Environment%0A&amp;body=Hey%2C%20found%20this%20on%20Penske%20Logistics's%20Front%20Page%20and%20thought%20you%20would%20like%20it%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.penskelogistics.com%2Findustries%2Ffood-and-beverage%2Ffsma-warehouse-technology%2F%233ed95\" data-uw-rm-vglnk=\"\" uw-rm-vague-link-id=\"mailto:?subject=%0awarehouse%20technology%20a%20must-have%20in%20fsma%20environment%0a&amp;body=hey%2c%20found%20this%20on%20penske%20logistics's%20front%20page%20and%20thought%20you%20would%20like%20it%3a%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.penskelogistics.com%2findustries%2ffood-and-beverage%2ffsma-warehouse-technology%2f%233ed95$send an email to ?subject=%0awarehouse%20technology%20a%20must-have%20in%20fsma%20environment%0a&amp;body=hey%2c%20found%20this%20on%20penske%20logistics's%20front%20page%20and%20thought%20you%20would%20like%20it%3a%20https%3a%2f%2fwww.penskelogistics.com%2findustries%2ffood-and-beverage%2ffsma-warehouse-technology%2f%233ed95\">\n        <span style=\"display:none;\">Share using em</span>\n        <i class=\"icons-share em sprite-shares-email sprite-shares-small-email\"></i>\n    </a>\n</li></ul>\n        </li>\n        <li class=\"close-share-mobile-wrap\">\n            <a href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"close-share-mobile\" title=\"Close sharing options\" aria-label=\"Close this option\" data-uw-rm-empty-ctrl=\"\">\n                <span style=\"display:none;\">Close sharing options</span>\n                <i class=\"icons-share cls sprite-shares-close sprite-shares-small-close\"></i>\n            </a>\n        </li>\n        <li class=\"show-share-mobile-wrap\">\n            <a href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"show-share-mobile\" title=\"Show sharing options\" aria-label=\"Show sharing options\" data-uw-rm-empty-ctrl=\"\">\n                <span style=\"display:none;\">Show sharing options</span>\n                <i class=\"icons-share cls sprite-shares-share sprite-shares-small-share\"></i>\n            </a>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n</div></div><p class=\"footnote\">With Tier 1 systems, companies can maximize productivity and the movement of products within a warehouse.</p></div></div>"

        "content": "<div id=\"content-c442b43\" class=\"content-c3cf63f\">In today’s fast-paced market, companies are constantly seeking ways to reduce costs while maintaining high service levels. One of the most effective approaches lies in optimizing logistics strategies. This blog post will explore how implementing Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory systems combined with advanced analytics can not only streamline operations but also significantly cut down on logistics expenses.\n\n<h3>Understanding Just-In-Time Inventory</h3>\n\nJust-in-Time (JIT) inventory is a strategy that minimizes stock levels by receiving goods only as they are needed in the production process. This approach helps businesses maintain lean inventories, which can lead to significant cost savings.\n\nThe principles of JIT focus on reducing waste—both in terms of excess inventory and time spent handling materials. Historically, JIT revolutionized manufacturing processes beginning with Toyota’s implementation in the 1970s, emphasizing efficiency and responsiveness within supply chains.\n\nBy adopting this methodology, organizations benefit from reduced holding costs associated with unsold goods, minimized waste due to spoilage or obsolescence, and improved cash flow since money isn’t tied up in unnecessary stock.\n\n<h3>The Role of Advanced Analytics in Logistics</h3>\n\nAdvanced analytics tools have become invaluable for organizations looking to enhance their logistics services. These technologies provide deep insights into data patterns and trends that inform better decision-making throughout the supply chain.\n\nFor instance, predictive analytics enable businesses to forecast demand accurately based on historical data and market conditions. Companies like Amazon have harnessed these capabilities successfully—using algorithms to predict customer preferences and optimize their fulfillment centers accordingly.\n\nMoreover, real-time visibility into shipping routes allows firms to adjust plans dynamically based on unforeseen circumstances such as weather disruptions or traffic delays—a capability increasingly essential for any modern freight solutions provider.\n\n<h3>Integrating JIT with Advanced Analytics</h3>\n\nImplementing a combined approach of JIT inventory management alongside advanced analytics requires careful planning:\n\n1. **Assess Current Inventory Practices**: Begin by evaluating existing practices around procurement cycles and storage capacities.\n   \n2. **Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Establish metrics that align with your business goals—whether it’s turnover rates or order accuracy—to track progress effectively.\n   \n3. **Use Data Insights**: Leverage analytical tools to refine ordering processes based on actual consumption versus forecasts; this ensures you’re aligned closely with current demand patterns without overstocking items unnecessarily.\n\nThis systematic integration fosters an agile environment where decisions are driven by robust data rather than gut feelings alone—and ultimately leads toward significant efficiencies across operations.\n\n<h3>Real-World Examples: Success Stories from Leading Companies</h3>\n\nSeveral companies stand out for successfully integrating JIT with advanced analytics:\n\n– A major automotive manufacturer succeeded in reducing parts inventory by 30% through precise forecasting models paired with just-in-time techniques.\n  \n– An e-commerce giant achieved same-day delivery capabilities thanks largely to optimized stock levels derived from real-time sales data analysis—showcasing how technology enhances traditional methodologies within supply chains effectively.\n\nThese examples illustrate tangible benefits realized when connecting innovative logistical strategies directly tied into operational execution frameworks!\n\n<h3>Challenges &amp; Considerations</h3>\n\nWhile there are numerous advantages associated with transitioning towards a JIT system complemented by advanced analytic methods; challenges do exist too! \n\nPotential risks include reliance upon single suppliers leading vulnerabilities during disruptions—or poor forecasting resulting either undersupply situations causing customer dissatisfaction—or oversupply scenarios leading back towards costly warehousing implications once again!\n\nTo mitigate these issues proactively consider employing contingency planning measures alongside diversifying supplier relationships whenever possible ensuring resilience against unexpected fluctuations impacting material availability overall…\n\n<h3>Future Trends in Logistics Cost Reduction</h3>\n \nAs we look ahead at future trends shaping tomorrow’s landscape within logistics cost reduction efforts—it becomes evident that artificial intelligence (AI) coupled machine learning applications continue driving notable advancements enhancing overall efficiency gains across various sectors alike!\n\nAdditionally focusing sustainability initiatives while balancing economic priorities grows increasingly vital particularly given today’s heightened attention surrounding environmental responsibility among consumers themselves thereby influencing purchasing behaviors more than ever before..\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs competition intensifies across industries—from small startups scaling quickly amidst rapid growth trajectories all way through established enterprises adapting long-term viability roadmaps alike—the need mastering effective logistical strategies remains crucial moving forward if aiming achieve sustainable success continuously over time irrespective external pressures encountered along journey itself…\n\nBy embracing just-in-time inventory management alongside leveraging cutting-edge analytical techniques—not only can businesses unlock substantial savings—but also enhance operational agility paving pathways towards durable growth opportunities amid an ever-evolving marketplace landscape!!\n\nReady for your organization take its next step?
